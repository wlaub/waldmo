    This feels wrong.
    Don't try it.
        I warned you, dog.
    Everything is fine (red ink)
    ...ere there is only meat...
    causal narratives of dubious veracity
    full of sound but devoid of meaning

    A finite reality bounded by mutually exclusive desires

    (braid quote)
    There's a Victory Point (VP) on the ground here
        +1 VP!


    Reality is a pharmakon.
     Explanation is inherently lossy. That's the point.
    We have to take it on faith that there is such a thing as objective reality, and that we are part of it.
    Everything happens for a reason, but the true and complete reason is unknowable.
    If choice doesn't exist, then reality isn't bad on purpose.
   You can't have a mind without a body, and you can't have a body without suffering.
    I have never seen the original object - only the =part of me= it created
    Normality, familiarity, and comfort are fragile illusions in ways we cannot comprehend.
    If the world I'm experiencing isn't congruent with my understanding of the real world, then either my understanding is wrong, or this isn't the real world.
        And since I prefer the real world as I understand it to the experience I'm having, I choose to conclude that this isn't the real world.
     We make assumptions about what it means to be a mind that we can never even know we made, and it's likely that most of them are false.
    The world doesn't end. It only gets worse.
     People are just conceptual forms imposed on impressions of reality in an effort to explain experiences.
    Every finite narrative of causation rests on dubious epistemology.
    And yet we don't experience the world as absent of choice. We don't experience cause as diffuse.
     Have you ever wondered why your eyes feel empty?
    Your experience of reality is a collection of approximations and heuristics, none of them valid. It is not the real thing. You will never experience objective reality.
     Why are you here?
        I am here because
