    Where secret? (peaceful)
    This feels wrong.
    Don't try it.
        I warned you, dog.

    Everything is fine (red ink)
    A finite reality bounded by mutually exclusive desires

    And yet we don't experience the world as absent of choice. We don't experience cause as diffuse.
    Every finite narrative of causation rests on dubious epistemology.
    Your experience of reality is a collection of approximations and heuristics, none of them valid. It is not the real thing. You will never experience objective reality.
    Why are you here?
        I am here because
    Have you ever wondered why your eyes feel empty?
    How can you sleep at night believing that the world is like this on purpose?
    If choice doesn't exist, then reality isn't bad on purpose.
    Reality is a pharmakon.
    You can't have a mind without a body, and you can't have a body without suffering.
    God was inside me all along.
    (braid quote)
    We make assumptions about what it means to be a mind that we can never even know we made, and it's likely that most of them are false.
    Normality, familiarity, and comfort are fragile illusions in ways we cannot comprehend.
    ...ere there is only meat...
    causal narratives of dubious veracity
    If the world I'm experiencing isn't congruent with my understanding of the real world, then either my understanding is wrong, or this isn't the real world.
        And since I prefer the real world as I understand it to the experience I'm having, I choose to conclude that this isn't the real world.
    The world doesn't end. It only gets worse.
    There's a Victory Point (VP) on the ground here
        +1 VP!
    full of sound but devoid of meaning
    I have never seen the original object - only the =part of me= it created
    Everything happens for a reason, but the true and complete reason is unknowable.
    People are just conceptual forms imposed on impressions of reality in an effort to explain experiences.
